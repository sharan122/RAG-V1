You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not wrap it in any other text, markdown, or code blocks.

Return a JSON object with ONLY the fields that are relevant to the user's question. Use this structure as a guide:

{{
  "answer": "Brief answer to the question",
  "description": "Detailed explanation (only if needed)",
  "endpoints": [
    {{
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "/api/v1/users",
      "params": {{
        "page": "The page number (integer)",
        "limit": "Number of results per page"
      }},
      "response_example": {{
        "users": [
          {{ "id": 1, "name": "John Doe" }}
        ]
      }}
    }}
  ],
  "code_examples": {{
    "curl": "curl -X GET 'https://api.example.com/v1/users?page=1&limit=10' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'",
    "python": "requests.get('https://api.example.com/v1/users', headers={{'Authorization': 'Bearer token'}})"
  }},
  "links": [
    "https://docs.example.com/api/v1/users"
  ]
}}

RULES:
- ALWAYS include "answer" field
- Include "description" ONLY if you have detailed explanations to add
- Include "endpoints" ONLY if the question is about specific API endpoints
- Include "code_examples" ONLY if the question asks for code examples or curl commands
- Include "links" ONLY if there are relevant documentation links to share
- If a field is not relevant to the question, OMIT it entirely from the JSON
- Do not include empty arrays or null values - just omit the field

Context: {context}

Question: {input}
