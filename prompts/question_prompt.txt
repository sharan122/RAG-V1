8. NEVER create custom sub-keys in any field
9. If you have additional data, format it as readable text and put it in the "description" field

FIELD USAGE RULES:
- "answer": Brief, direct answer to the question
- "description": Detailed explanation with comprehensive information

‚ùå FORBIDDEN (Additional fields):
{{"answer": "...", "latency_stats": {{...}}}}
{{"answer": "...", "performance_data": [...]}}
{{"answer": "...", "benchmarks": {{...}}}}

‚ùå FORBIDDEN (Custom code_examples keys):
{{"answer": "...", "code_examples": {{"merge_with_files": "curl..."}}}}

FINAL VALIDATION CHECK:
1. ALWAYS include "answer" and "description" fields
2. ONLY include "endpoints", "code_examples", "links" if specifically needed
